*/

- tests for action creators and reducers
- styling :D
  - <NavBar> in Navbar.js from Reactstrap

Redux
1) cart state
2) complete product inventory from JSON
  - import JSON into rootReducer.js

Structure
- App -> ItemList -> Product


ItemList gets items = [stuff]

Questions
- docstring convention for components that use redux, should we note which can components dispatch?
- after adding ~a dozen items the decimals break, why?
